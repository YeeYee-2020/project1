                    <p>Only 19 kilometres (12 miles) from Perth, car-free Rottnest Island takes you back in time to when life was relaxed and simple. Along with more than 60 beaches, coral reefs harbouring tropical fish, and history-packed buildings, Rottnest is home to an Instagram star, the friendly quokka, a marsupial found only in Western Australia. The friendly creature has been dubbed �the happiest animal in the world�,
                       comically pulling cheeky grins and adorable smiles for the camera. Because quokkas are so trusting, care needs to be taken when posing with them for a photo. Using a selfie stick is a good idea, allowing you to stay a respectful distance.</p>
